Skybox Editor

Hey there! This is a super straightforward and minimalistic skybox editor for Unity.

I will be uploading this to itch.io and the Unity Asset Store briefly
(if this line is still here, it means either I've forgotten to do this, or I have not yet gotten around to it)

Instructions
Once the package is installed, under Tools, you should be able to select "Skybox Editor" to open the editor window.
Customization is pretty straightforward. Make sure to hit the "Set Skybox" button to update your current skybox to the one you have created.

Notes
It is important to keep the file structure as is. Moving the folders around will mess up the paths referenced in scripting.

Future plans
More features are to come!
I am planning on implementing:
- Animated skyboxes
- Skybox transitions
- Stars
- Clouds

Let me know what else you all would like to see! No guarantees that I will get to all of the features.

Feel free to use this in your projects! No attribution required.

Much love,
Lu
